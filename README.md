# üß± Ruby on Rails RESTful API

## üìñ Description
This project is a RESTful API application built with **Ruby on Rails**.  
It includes five main models ‚Äî **User**, **Article**, **Comment**, **Tag**, and **ArticleTag** ‚Äî that support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The system defines relational connections between users, articles, comments, and tags.  
When the server starts, it will display a simple message:  
> **"The server is running"**

You can then access the API data by visiting the appropriate **endpoints** (for example, `/api/v1/articles`, `/api/v1/comments`, etc.) using HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
